In many sci fi movies released about 10 or 15 years ago, people imagined they would be able to control computers or electrical devices with their hand gestures. Now we have technologies using cameras that detect motions by calculating the coordinates of hands or body. Motion detection is widely used, and has great potential in game industries virtual reality (VR) and tech industries. This time, I built classification models to classify hand gestures.

UCI repository provides hand gesture data: "Gesture Phase Segmentation Data Set". It is open source data and you can download from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gesture+phase+segmentation. The details of data are explained in their pages, so I will not explain here and I only used their processed data (excluded raw data)
